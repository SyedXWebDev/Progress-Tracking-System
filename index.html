<h1>Daily Progress Documentation System</h1>
Hey, this is my little digital progress tracker for leveling up through self-directed learning and personal <strong>growth</strong>. I built this to keep myself <strong>accountable</strong> and to make consistency my superpower by tracking my progress every day.</p> <p>I'm starting to see how much tracking my progress lights a fire under me. So, I'm going all-in with some <strong>visual</strong> ways to record what I do each day. This is where I'll dump all my daily wins, tasks, and random thoughts. Just me, showing up for myself!</p>

    <p class="p2">Alright, so this is where it all kicked off — <strong>May 21, 2024</strong>. I started snapping daily headshots, just to capture memories and maybe spot changes in my face over time. I was just tossing them into my Google Drive, nothing fancy. A few months in, I realized — whoa, I've unintentionally documented this whole transformation of my facial features. It's like a time-lapse of me! That got me thinking: why not do this for <strong>"everything"</strong> in my life? <strong>Tracking progress</strong> like this feels like a reward for showing up every day. It's my way of <strong>celebrating consistency,</strong> and I'm hyped to keep it going!</p>
